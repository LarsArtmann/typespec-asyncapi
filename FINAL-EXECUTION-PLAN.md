- **No Performance Optimization** until core functionality complete
- **No Documentation** until core features stable

### **SUCCESS TRACKING:**
- **Daily:** Update issue comments with progress
- **Weekly:** Review milestone completion status
- **Monthly:** Assess overall production readiness
- **Continuous:** Maintain zero compilation errors

## ðŸ“ˆ **FINAL REMARKS**

**Project is at critical juncture where systematic resolution of 3 critical issues will unlock rapid progress toward production readiness. The foundation is solid (build system working, patterns established), just need to resolve execution blockers.**

**Next session should focus 100% on Issue #178 resolution, as it's the single largest blocker preventing all other progress.**

**Priority order:**
1. **Issue #178** (Test Hanging) - EMERGENCY
2. **Issue #179** (Decorator Registration) - QUICK WIN  
3. **Issue #172** (@server Decorator) - CRITICAL

**All other work depends on these 3 critical issues being resolved first.**
