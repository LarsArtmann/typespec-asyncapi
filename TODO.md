## Success Criteria

✅ All examples compile without errors
✅ All generated AsyncAPI specs are valid
✅ All tests pass with build-before-test policy
✅ Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
✅ Code is production-ready with proper error handling
✅ Performance benchmarks meet requirements
✅ CLI and tooling work seamlessly
✅ Project is ready for v1.0 release

## Key Technical Requirements

- Use correct TypeSpec 1.4.0 syntax discovered in smoke test
- Maintain Effect.TS patterns throughout
- Ensure proper AsyncAPI 3.0 compliance
- Follow production-ready code standards
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## Execution Strategy

1. **INCREMENTAL**: Fix one example at a time, validate each step
2. **VALIDATION**: Test compilation after every change
3. **DOCUMENTATION**: Update docs immediately after each working example
4. **QUALITY**: Run lint and test checks continuously
5. **COMMIT**: Commit working progress frequently

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes (highest ROI)
- **Phase 2**: 45 minutes (production readiness)
- **Phase 3**: 30 minutes (final polish)
- **Total**: 105 minutes (1 hour 45 minutes)

This focused plan will complete the v1.0 readiness with systematic execution and validation at each step.
