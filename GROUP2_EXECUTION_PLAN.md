- [x] **M21**: Create WebSocket plugin interface definition ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **M22**: Extract WebSocket binding logic from core emitter ✅ COMPLETED  
- [x] **M23**: Test WebSocket plugin with real compilation ✅ COMPLETED

### AMQP PLUGIN ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **M24**: Create AMQP plugin interface definition ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **M25**: Extract AMQP binding logic from core emitter ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **M26**: Implement AMQP queue declarations and exchanges ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **M27**: Test AMQP plugin with real compilation ✅ COMPLETED

### MQTT PLUGIN ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **M29**: Extract MQTT binding logic from core emitter ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **M30**: Implement MQTT topic hierarchies and QoS settings ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **M31**: Test MQTT plugin with real compilation ✅ COMPLETED

## ANALYSIS RESULTS

### Current Plugin Architecture
- **Simple Plugin System**: Located at `/src/plugins/plugin-system.ts`
- **Built-in Plugins**: `/src/plugins/built-in/` contains kafka, websocket, http plugins
- **Plugin Registry**: Uses `SimplePluginRegistry` with Effect.TS patterns
- **Plugin Interface**: `ProtocolPlugin` with Effect-based methods

### Test Fixtures Analysis
- **MASSIVE FILE**: 1822 lines in single file is maintenance nightmare
- **Structure Analysis**: 
  - TypeSpecFixtures: Lines 24-1253 (1229 lines of TypeSpec code)
  - AsyncAPIFixtures: Lines 1256-1411 (155 lines of expected outputs)
  - EdgeCaseFixtures: Lines 1414-1522 (108 lines of edge cases)
  - PerformanceFixtures: Lines 1525-1624 (99 lines of performance tests)
  - ErrorFixtures: Lines 1627-1716 (89 lines of error scenarios)
  - TestDataGenerator: Lines 1719-1823 (104 lines of generators)

### Protocol Support Status
- **Kafka**: ✅ Implemented plugin exists
- **WebSocket**: ✅ Basic plugin exists, needs extraction from core
- **HTTP**: ✅ Implemented plugin exists  
- **AMQP**: ❌ Missing dedicated plugin
- **MQTT**: ❌ Missing dedicated plugin

## EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Test Fixtures Splitting (M16-M20)
1. **Split Strategy**: 
   - `CoreFixtures.ts`: Core concepts, data types, operations (60% of content)
   - `EdgeCaseFixtures.ts`: Edge cases, error scenarios, validation (25% of content)
   - `PerformanceFixtures.ts`: Performance tests, large datasets (15% of content)
   - Update imports across all test files

### Phase 2: Plugin Extraction (M21-M31)
1. **WebSocket Plugin**: Extract from existing websocket-plugin.ts, enhance for real compilation
2. **AMQP Plugin**: Create new plugin based on protocol-bindings.ts AMQP logic
3. **MQTT Plugin**: Create new plugin with QoS settings, topic hierarchies
4. **Integration**: Ensure all plugins work with PluginRegistry system
