# Session Learnings: Import Fixes & Ghost System Discovery

**Date:** 2025-10-05T00:44:00+0000
**Session:** Import path fixes → GitHub issues cleanup → Brutal self-reflection
**Duration:** ~6 hours across 2 sessions

---

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. **Always Verify End-to-End FIRST**

**What Happened:**
- Spent 4 hours fixing import paths in 24 test files
- Achieved 406/579 tests passing (70%)
- Declared victory: "Import fixes complete!"
- NEVER tested if `tsp compile` actually works
- Discovered later: Tests use wrong package name, emitter can't be imported

**What I Learned:**
- **Test the happy path before fixing anything else**
- "Passing tests" mean nothing if the core functionality doesn't work
- End-to-end smoke test should be the FIRST test, not the last

**New Rule:**
```
ALWAYS start with:
1. Does `tsp compile example.tsp` work? YES/NO
2. If NO: Fix THAT first
3. If YES: Then fix tests
```

**Estimated Cost of This Mistake:** 4 hours wasted

---

### 2. **Ghost Systems Are Worse Than Broken Systems**

**What Happened:**
- Found `test/plugins/enhanced-protocol-plugins.test.ts` (350 lines)
- Tests 3 plugins: WebSocket, AMQP, MQTT
- None of these plugins exist!
- Tests have commented-out imports: `// DISABLED: import from enhanced-amqp-plugin (file not found)`
- These tests pass (0 assertions actually run)

**What I Learned:**
- **Commented-out code is a code smell for ghost systems**
- Tests that don't test anything are worse than no tests
- Better to have 100 valuable tests than 579 mixed-quality tests

**New Rule:**
```
Before fixing tests:
1. Run: find . -name "*.test.ts" | xargs grep "DISABLED\|TODO\|FIXME"
2. If found: DELETE or FIX immediately
3. Don't fix imports for code that doesn't exist
```

**Estimated Cost of This Mistake:** Tests waste 5+ seconds per run, confuse new contributors

---

### 3. **Multiple Test Utility Systems = Technical Debt**

**What Happened:**
- Found `test/utils/test-helpers.ts` (1095 lines)
- Found `test/e2e/test-host.ts` (AsyncAPITestLibrary)
- Both provide similar functionality
- Tests import from both randomly
- Duplication creates maintenance burden

**What I Learned:**
- **One way to do it** - consolidate utilities before scaling tests
- Duplication happens gradually if not monitored
- Should have consolidated BEFORE fixing imports

**New Rule:**
```
When adding new test utility:
1. Does similar functionality exist? YES/NO
2. If YES: Extend existing utility
3. If NO: Document why new utility is needed
4. Review utilities every 10 test files added
```

**Estimated Cost:** 2x maintenance effort, contributor confusion

---

### 4. **Package Name Typos Are Silent Killers**

**What Happened:**
- Package.json: `@lars-artmann/typespec-asyncapi`
- Tests import: `@larsartmann/typespec-asyncapi` (missing hyphen!)
- All tests fail with "import-not-found"
- Error message doesn't hint at typo

**What I Learned:**
- **Test imports in isolation** - Don't assume imports work
- Typos in package names are hard to spot in error messages
- Should have run actual `tsp compile` to catch this immediately

**New Rule:**
```
After any package.json name change:
1. Grep codebase for old name
2. Run example compilation
3. Verify published package matches expectation
```

**Estimated Cost:** Could block all production usage

---

### 5. **Session Summaries Belong in docs/, Not GitHub Issues**

**What Happened:**
- Found 4 GitHub issues that are session summaries (#125, #120, #103, #67)
- These aren't actionable work items
- They clog the issues list
- Hard to find actual bugs/features among documentation

**What I Learned:**
- **Issues = actionable work only**
- Session notes → `docs/sessions/`
- Architectural decisions → `docs/adr/`
- Keep issues focused on things that need doing

**New Rule:**
```
Create GitHub issue when:
- Bug needs fixing
- Feature needs implementing
- Question needs answering

Create docs/ file when:
- Documenting what was done
- Recording architectural decisions
- Sharing session insights
```

**Estimated Cost:** Issues list cluttered, real work harder to find

---

### 6. **Test Quality > Test Quantity**

**What Happened:**
- Have 579 total tests
- 173 failing (30%)
- Many passing tests don't provide value
- Enhanced plugin tests = 0 value (test nothing)
- Better to have 200 high-value tests than 579 mixed tests

**What I Learned:**
- **Delete low-value tests aggressively**
- Focus on behavior tests, not implementation tests
- One good end-to-end test worth 10 unit tests

**New Rule:**
```
For each test file, ask:
1. If this test passes, what behavior is guaranteed?
2. If this test fails, what broke?
3. If answers are vague → DELETE or REWRITE
```

**Target:** 200 high-value tests, not 579 mixed tests

---

### 7. **Performance Testing Infrastructure Needs Usage or Deletion**

**What Happened:**
- Found `PerformanceRegressionTester.ts` (464 lines)
- Found `ConfigurableMetrics.ts` (extensive infrastructure)
- No baselines captured
- No CI integration
- Never used in production

**What I Learned:**
- **Infrastructure without usage is dead code**
- "We might need this later" leads to unused code
- Delete aggressively, recreate if actually needed

**New Rule:**
```
For any "testing infrastructure":
1. Is it used in CI? YES/NO
2. Is it used by developers? YES/NO
3. If both NO: DELETE within 30 days
4. "Future-proofing" = premature optimization
```

**Estimated Cost:** 464 lines to maintain, confuses contributors

---

### 8. **Railway Programming Requires Consistent Application**

**What Happened:**
- Library code uses Effect.TS patterns (good!)
- Test code still uses promises (bad!)
- Mixed patterns create confusion
- Issue #112 tracks "Effect.TS in tests" but not prioritized

**What I Learned:**
- **Consistency matters more than perfection**
- Half-migrated patterns are worse than old patterns
- Should either fully migrate or not migrate at all

**New Rule:**
```
When adopting new pattern:
1. Identify scope: Library only? Library + Tests? Everything?
2. Set deadline for full migration
3. Don't leave hybrid state indefinitely
4. Document: "We use X for Y, Z for everything else"
```

**Estimated Cost:** Confuses contributors, inconsistent error handling

---

### 9. **Import Fixes Are Symptoms, Not Root Causes**

**What Happened:**
- Spent 4 hours fixing imports after architecture refactor
- Fixed symptoms (wrong paths) not root cause (poor refactoring process)
- Should have: 1) Refactor, 2) Run tests immediately, 3) Fix breaks

**What I Learned:**
- **Test immediately after refactoring**
- Don't let import errors accumulate
- Batch refactoring without testing = technical debt

**New Rule:**
```
When refactoring:
1. Move file
2. Update imports
3. Run tests
4. Commit
5. Repeat
(NOT: Move 20 files, update nothing, commit, fix later)
```

**Estimated Cost:** 4 hours of tedious manual fixes

---

### 10. **Brutal Honesty Catches More Problems**

**What Happened:**
- First status report: "Import fixes complete! 70% tests passing!"
- Brutal honesty review: "Did you verify emitter works? NO."
- Discovered multiple ghost systems, wrong package names, etc.

**What I Learned:**
- **Question your own claims**
- "Complete" needs clear definition
- Always ask: "What didn't I test?"

**New Rule:**
```
Before declaring "done":
1. What did I NOT test?
2. What assumptions did I make?
3. What could still be broken?
4. Did I test the thing users actually care about?
```

**This learning itself is meta-learning about learning!**

**LESSON SUMMARY: Fix what users care about first, delete what doesn't exist, consolidate what's duplicated, then fix the details.**
