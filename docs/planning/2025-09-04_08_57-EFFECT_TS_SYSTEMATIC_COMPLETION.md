## üìù EXECUTION COMMANDS

### Phase 1: Initialize Parallel Execution (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Verify build status
just build && just lint

# Spawn 3 parallel agents for maximum throughput
# Agent 1: Core emitter conversion  
# Agent 2: Throw statement replacement
# Agent 3: Critical type fixes
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure & Architecture (SEQUENTIAL)
```bash  
# After Phase 1 completion - architecture depends on core patterns
# Pipeline optimization + validation conversion
```

### Phase 3: Quality & Testing (PARALLEL)
```bash
# Independent quality improvements - can run parallel to Phase 2
# ESLint fixes + comprehensive testing
```

### Verification After Each Phase
```bash
just build        # Ensure TypeScript compilation
just lint         # Verify ESLint improvements  
just test         # Maintain test suite integrity
just typecheck    # Confirm type safety
```
