- <what-changed>

Impact:
- Tests: <before> → <after> passing
- Lines: <added>/<deleted>

Contributes to: <customer-value>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

git push origin feature/effect-ts-complete-migration
```

### Types of Commits

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Quantitative
- ✅ Test pass rate: **90%+** (540/605)
- ✅ Domain tests added: **25+**
- ✅ Ghost systems removed: **2+**
- ✅ Code deleted: **500+ lines**
- ✅ Documentation files: **5+**

### Qualitative
- ✅ All ValidationService binding issues resolved
- ✅ Zero "Alpha fallback" fake data in tests
- ✅ Modern TypeSpec testing patterns adopted
- ✅ Architecture clearly documented
- ✅ Future sessions have reusable prompts

### Non-Goals (Scope Control)
- ❌ Implement new AsyncAPI features
- ❌ Refactor entire emitter architecture
- ❌ Achieve 100% test coverage
- ❌ Fix ALL 580 tests (some may be obsolete)

## RISK MITIGATION

| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|-------------|
| ValidationService fix > 2h | Research DocumentBuilder pattern first | Skip to Phase 1 tasks, revisit later |
| Domain tests take > 8h | Use test-helpers utilities, reduce to 20 tests | Still meets 80%+ pass rate goal |
| Breaking changes in refactoring | Commit after each task, run tests before push | Revert last commit, try smaller change |
| Scope creep during execution | Stick to 36 tasks, defer new ideas to GitHub issues | Create issue, continue with plan |

---

## NOTES

1. **Time estimates include:** Research, implementation, testing, commit
2. **Lines changed are estimates** based on similar past work
3. **Customer value focuses on** business logic validation, not infrastructure tests
4. **Priority P0** must complete before P1, but P1/P2 can interleave
5. **Git commits** are MANDATORY after each task - no batching
