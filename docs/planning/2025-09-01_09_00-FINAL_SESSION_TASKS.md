## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTION STRATEGY

1. **Sequential Critical Path**: Complete Priority 1 (Test Suite) first - all other work depends on it
2. **Parallel Execution**: Priorities 2-4 can run in parallel after Priority 1 
3. **Final Integration**: Priority 5 (Production Readiness) validates everything works together
4. **Polish Phase**: Priorities 6-8 are quality improvements and can be done in any order

**Total Estimated Time**: 480 minutes (8 hours) across all priorities
**Critical Path Time**: 90 minutes (Priority 1 must complete first)
**Parallel Work Available**: 240 minutes can run in parallel after critical path
