# TypeSpec AsyncAPI Decorator Completion Plan

**Session**: 2025-08-31_09_55  
**Project**: TypeSpec AsyncAPI Emitter  
**Focus**: Complete decorator functionality and comprehensive testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

The TypeSpec AsyncAPI emitter has successfully resolved critical infrastructure issues (library loading, build pipeline, memory management) but the core decorator functionality is not connected to the final AsyncAPI document generation. This plan implements the remaining work using Pareto analysis to deliver maximum value efficiently.

## ðŸ“Š Pareto Analysis Results

### 1% Tasks Delivering 51% of Value
**CRITICAL BLOCKER**: Decorator data is not flowing from TypeSpec processing to AsyncAPI document generation
- Current state: Empty AsyncAPI documents (valid structure, no content)
- Impact: Without this fix, the emitter is architecturally complete but functionally useless
- Customer impact: Cannot generate populated AsyncAPI specifications from TypeSpec

### 4% Tasks Delivering 64% of Value (+13%)
**CORE FUNCTIONALITY**: Test and validate decorator processing works end-to-end
- Comprehensive testing of @channel, @publish, @subscribe, @server decorators
- End-to-end validation of TypeSpec â†’ AsyncAPI conversion with real data
- Debug and fix any remaining decorator processing pipeline issues

### 20% Tasks Delivering 80% of Value (+16%)  
**QUALITY & COMPLETENESS**: Production-ready features and documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage and error handling
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Documentation and real-world examples
- Advanced decorator features and compliance testing
