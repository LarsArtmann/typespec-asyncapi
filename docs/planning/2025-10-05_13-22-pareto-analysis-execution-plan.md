## 📊 PARETO ANALYSIS

### Current Situation Analysis

**What's Blocking v1.0.0**:
1. **252 failing tests** (32.5% failure rate) - Can't release with this
2. **Multiple test helper systems** - Ghost system causing confusion
3. **No performance optimization** - Compilation is acceptable but could be 50-70% faster
4. **No code coverage** - Can't measure test quality
5. **284 TODO comments** - Technical debt not tracked

**Customer Impact Assessment**:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Failing tests = unreliable library
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Test infrastructure chaos = can't validate correctness
- 🟡 **HIGH**: Performance matters for large schemas
- 🟢 **MEDIUM**: Code coverage = quality assurance
- 🟢 **LOW**: TODO comments = internal debt

## 🥇 THE 1% - DELIVERS 51% OF VALUE

### Single Most Impactful Task

**#127: Complete TypeSpec 1.4.0 Test Migration**

**Why This One Task Delivers 51% of Value**:

1. **Fixes Test Infrastructure** - Root cause of most failures
   - Old API doesn't pass options correctly
   - File caching between tests causes false failures
   - Wrong test helpers used in 80% of failing tests

2. **Unlocks Everything Else** - Can't fix tests without this
   - Can't measure real pass rate until infrastructure works
   - Can't implement features without reliable tests
   - Can't optimize what we can't measure

3. **Immediate Impact** - Expected results
   - **252 failing → ~100 failing** (60% reduction)
   - **67.4% pass rate → 80%+ pass rate**
   - **Clean foundation** for all other work

**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours
**Expected Result**: 80%+ test pass rate, clean test infrastructure

**Breakdown**:
1. Migrate `test/decorators/server.test.ts` (14 failing tests) - 2 hours
2. Migrate 4 E2E test files - 2 hours
3. Migrate integration tests - 1.5 hours
4. Verify pass rate >80% - 0.5 hours
