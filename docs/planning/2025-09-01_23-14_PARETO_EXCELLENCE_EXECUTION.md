### **COORDINATION PROTOCOL**

```
Hour 0-2: Agent A establishes foundation (M1-M14)
Hour 2-4: All agents work in parallel (handoff points established)
Hour 4-6: Integration checkpoints and cross-agent validation
Hour 6-8: Final integration and end-to-end testing
Hour 8+: Production deployment validation and documentation
```

**EXECUTION BEGINS NOW: Maximum leverage through systematic Pareto-focused development**

## **🔥 CALL TO ACTION**

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Launch 3 parallel Task agents with Group A/B/C assignments
2. **Hour 1:** Validate working code generation foundation
3. **Hour 2:** Confirm developer onboarding friction-free experience
4. **Hour 4:** Integration checkpoint and cross-agent validation
5. **Hour 8:** Complete platform demonstration with production deployment

**PRINCIPLE:** Every 15-minute micro-task must deliver measurable customer value. No work without direct business impact validation.

**TARGET:** Transform from foundation to production-ready platform in 8 hours of focused execution.
