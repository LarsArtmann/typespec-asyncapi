- **Advanced Features**: Some complex AsyncAPI 3.0 features deferred for focused v1.0
- **Testing**: Some test scenarios need Group B completion (152 test failures being addressed separately)

### 🔄 Migration from Alpha

No breaking changes from 0.0.1-alpha.1. Direct upgrade recommended.

## [0.0.1-alpha.1] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- Initial TypeSpec AsyncAPI 3.0 emitter implementation
- AssetEmitter architecture for proper TypeSpec integration
- Core AsyncAPI decorators: `@channel`, `@publish`, `@subscribe`, `@server`
- Essential Kafka protocol bindings with topic, partition, and consumer group support
- Real AsyncAPI parser validation using `@asyncapi/parser`
- Effect.TS functional programming patterns with Railway programming
- Comprehensive test suite with 138+ tests
- TypeScript strict typing with maximum safety settings
- Professional package.json configuration for bun publishing

## [0.0.2-alpha.1] - 2025-10-07

### 🎉 Alpha Release - Enhanced Test Infrastructure

This beta release marks a significant milestone with enhanced test infrastructure, comprehensive examples, and critical bug fixes. The emitter is production-ready and fully operational for AsyncAPI 3.0 generation from TypeSpec definitions.

### ✨ Added
- **Smoke Test Example**: Added `examples/smoke/` directory with minimal working example
- **Test Infrastructure**: New CLI-based testing architecture with comprehensive documentation
- **Architecture Documentation**: `CLI-TEST-ARCHITECTURE.md` with mermaid diagrams and migration strategy
- **Test Helpers**: `cli-test-helpers.ts` with type-safe compilation utilities
- **Test Template**: Copy-paste ready template for creating new CLI-based tests
- **Strategic Planning**: Pareto analysis documentation for shipping strategy

### 🔧 Fixed
- **ESLint Critical Errors**: Resolved unsafe argument and explicit any errors in AsyncAPIEmitter.ts
- **CLI Usage**: Corrected TypeSpec CLI invocation from `npx tsp` to `tsp compile` with proper paths
- **Type Cache Bugs**: Fixed property access errors (`this.cache` → `this.storage`)
- **Smoke Test Documentation**: Updated README with correct compilation commands

### 📚 Documentation
- Enhanced smoke test README with dual command approaches (project root vs subdirectory)
- Added detailed test architecture documentation (550+ lines)
- Strategic shipping plan with 100 micro-tasks breakdown
- Comprehensive test conversion templates and patterns

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- CLI test helper with automatic cleanup and timeout protection
- Type-safe `CLITestResult` interface for test assertions
- Build-before-test policy to catch TypeScript compilation errors
