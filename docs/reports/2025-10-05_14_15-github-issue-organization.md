## 🔍 DUPLICATE ANALYSIS

### Confirmed Duplicates
1. **#107 & #106** - Same AsyncAPIEmitter.documentBuilder undefined error
   - **Action:** #107 marked as duplicate, already closed
   - **Keep:** #106 (more detailed)

### Potential Duplicates (Investigated, NOT Duplicates)
- **#90 vs #128** - Different: #90 = architectural ghost systems, #128 = ghost tests
- **#34 vs #132** - Different: #34 = achieve coverage, #132 = add coverage tool (dependency)
- **#111 vs #128 vs #130** - Different: Related but distinct issues (failures, ghost tests, errors)

### No Duplicates Found In:
- ESLint issues (#108, #110) - Sequential improvements, not duplicates
- Session summaries (#120, #124, #125) - Different sessions, properly closed
- TypeSpec issues - Each addresses different aspect

## 🚀 NEXT ACTIONS RECOMMENDED

### Immediate (Today)
1. ⏳ Review #126 status - close if complete
2. ⏳ Validate #127 milestone assignment
3. ⏳ Review #12 (v1.0.0 criteria) and update with current issues

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Execute #132 (Add code coverage) - BLOCKS multiple issues
2. Execute #130 (Fix 14 test errors) - Critical stability
3. Execute #135 (Add quality gates) - Prevent future issues
4. Execute #128 (Fix ghost tests) - Quality improvement

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Execute #111 (Fix 257 test failures) - After #128, #130 complete
2. Execute #34 (Achieve >80% coverage) - After #132, #128 complete
3. Review and prioritize "Future Enhancements" milestone
4. Close completed issues in "Ghost Systems Cleanup"

### Long Term (Next Sprint)
1. Execute protocol binding issues (#42, #43, #44)
2. Execute architectural improvements (#78, #79, #82)
3. Review RFC issues (#32, #77) for community input
4. Plan next milestone beyond v1.0.0

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Issue Organization Best Practices
1. ✅ **All critical issues MUST have milestones** - Ensures visibility and prioritization
2. ✅ **Session documentation should be closed** - Prevents clutter, keeps focus on actionable items
3. ✅ **Cross-reference related issues** - Helps understand dependencies
4. ✅ **Mark duplicates immediately** - Reduces confusion
5. ✅ **Document issue dependencies** - Critical for planning

### Patterns Observed
1. **Test quality issues cluster** - #111, #128, #130, #132, #135 all related
2. **Session summaries accumulate** - Close promptly after documentation extracted
3. **Architectural lessons (#66) should stay open** - Educational value for future decisions
4. **Performance issues can be deferred** - Focus on correctness first
