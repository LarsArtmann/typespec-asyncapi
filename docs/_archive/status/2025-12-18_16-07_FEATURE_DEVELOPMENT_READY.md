## 🤔 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Type Safety System (IMMEDIATE - Next Session)

**Question:** Effect.TS restoration vs custom validation system?

**Effect.TS Restoration:**

- **Pros:** Superior type safety, comprehensive error handling, existing patterns
- **Cons:** Risk of runtime crash recurrence, complex dependency management
- **Timeline:** 2-4 hours implementation, unknown stability risk

**Custom Validation System:**

- **Pros:** Full control, no external dependencies, simpler architecture
- **Cons:** Development effort, re-implementation of existing functionality
- **Timeline:** 4-6 hours implementation, predictable stability

**Recommendation:** Custom validation system to ensure stability, with future Effect.TS evaluation.

### Decision 2: Protocol Binding Architecture (IMMEDIATE - Session 2)

**Question:** Plugin system vs hardcoded implementations?

**Plugin System:**

- **Pros:** Extensibility, community contributions, clean separation
- **Cons:** Development overhead, complexity, maintenance burden
- **Timeline:** 4-6 hours design + implementation

**Hardcoded Implementation:**

- **Pros:** Simpler, faster development, predictable behavior
- **Cons:** Limited extensibility, maintenance overhead for new protocols
- **Timeline:** 2-3 hours implementation

**Recommendation:** Start with hardcoded core protocols, design for future plugin migration.

### Decision 3: Testing Strategy (IMMEDIATE - Session 3)

**Question:** BDD vs TDD vs hybrid approach?

**BDD Approach:**

- **Pros:** Business-readable tests, user focus, documentation value
- **Cons:** Learning curve, tooling complexity
- **Timeline:** 3-4 hours framework setup

**TDD Approach:**

- **Pros:** Developer focus, test-first methodology, tooling familiar
- **Cons:** Limited business perspective, maintenance overhead
- **Timeline:** 2-3 hours framework setup

**Recommendation:** Hybrid BDD/TDD approach - BDD for acceptance, TDD for unit tests.
