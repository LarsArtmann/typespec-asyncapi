- `src/infrastructure/configuration/asyncAPIEmitterOptions.ts` (190 lines, 16.84% duplicated)

**ROOT CAUSE:** Two identical configuration schemas maintained separately
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Developer confusion, maintenance overhead, potential inconsistency

#### **2. TEST FAILURE CRISIS**

**IMPACT:** System stability and reliability compromised
**METRICS:** 306 failing tests / 510 total = 63% failure rate
**AFFECTED AREAS:** Domain tests, protocol tests, security validation, real AsyncAPI validation

**ROOT CAUSE:** Outdated test expectations, missing implementations, architectural changes
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Broken CI/CD, reduced confidence, deployment risk

#### **3. TYPE SAFETY GAPS**

**IMPACT:** Runtime errors, impossible states representable
**METRICS:** 0% branded types implementation, 0% domain boundaries
**AFFECTED AREAS:** Configuration, decorators, emission, validation

**ROOT CAUSE:** String-based types instead of enforced domain types
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Runtime errors, maintenance overhead, unclear contracts

### **🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Within 72 Hours)**

#### **4. CODE QUALITY DEGRADATION**

**IMPACT:** Maintainability and development velocity compromised
**METRICS:** 105 ESLint warnings, 1.35% code duplication
**AFFECTED AREAS:** Code style, patterns, duplication

**ROOT CAUSE:** Rapid development without quality gates
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Slower development, technical debt accumulation

#### **5. PROTOCOL ABSTRACTION MISSING**

**IMPACT:** No extensibility, hardcoded protocol support
**METRICS:** 0% protocol abstraction implementation
**AFFECTED AREAS:** Kafka, WebSocket, HTTP protocol bindings

**ROOT CAUSE:** Monolithic emitter design without plugin architecture
**BUSINESS IMPACT:** Limited feature set, maintenance overhead, community contributions blocked

## ❓ CRITICAL BLOCKING QUESTION

### **CONFIGURATION SPLIT-BRAIN MIGRATION STRATEGY**

**"How do we eliminate the configuration split-brain disaster between `asyncAPIEmitterOptions.ts` and `options.ts` while maintaining backward compatibility AND ensuring we don't break the existing decorator system that depends on these types?"**

**SPECIFIC CONCERNS:**

1. Which configuration file should be the canonical source of truth?
2. How do we handle scattered imports throughout the codebase?
3. What migration strategy prevents breaking decorator functionality?
4. Should we use Zod, @effect/schema, or plain TypeScript for consolidated types?
5. How do we ensure TypeSpec compiler integration remains functional during migration?

**WHY THIS BLOCKS EXECUTION:**

- Identified 38.55% + 16.84% duplication but unclear on dependency graph
- Need to understand import relationships before consolidation
- Risk of breaking decorator system without careful migration planning
- Must preserve TypeSpec compilation functionality
