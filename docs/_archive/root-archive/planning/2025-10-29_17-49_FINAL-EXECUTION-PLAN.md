## 📈 **FINAL REMARKS**

**Project is at critical juncture where systematic resolution of 3 critical issues will unlock rapid progress toward production readiness. The foundation is solid (build system working, patterns established), just need to resolve execution blockers.**

**Next session should focus 100% on Issue #178 resolution, as it's the single largest blocker preventing all other progress.**

**Priority order:**

1. **Issue #178** (Test Hanging) - EMERGENCY
2. **Issue #179** (Decorator Registration) - QUICK WIN
3. **Issue #172** (@server Decorator) - CRITICAL

**All other work depends on these 3 critical issues being resolved first.**
