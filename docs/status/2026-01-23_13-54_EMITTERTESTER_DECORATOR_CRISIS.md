# 🔥 EMERGENCY STATUS REPORT - EMITTERTESTER DECORATOR CRISIS

**Report Date:** 2026-01-23 13:54:56 CET  
**Report Type:** Critical Infrastructure Failure Analysis  
**Current Phase:** Emergency Recovery & Decision Point  
**Build Status:** ✅ GREEN (0 TypeScript compilation errors)  
**Test Status:** 🔴 40.7% passing (246/605) | 54.5% failing (330/605)  
**Critical Blocker:** EmitterTester decorator loading failure

---

## 🚨 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE CRISIS

**THE PROBLEM:** TypeSpec AsyncAPI emitter decorators (@channel, @publish, @subscribe, @server) execute correctly with `createTestHost()` but **NEVER execute** when using `EmitterTester.compile()`. This blocks 250+ tests from validating any functionality.

**IMPACT:** All EmitterTester-based integration tests fail with empty state:
- Generated AsyncAPI documents have 0 channels
- Generated AsyncAPI documents have 0 operations  
- Generated AsyncAPI documents have 0 messages
- State remains empty: `{channels: {}, messages: {}, servers: {}}`

**DECISION REQUIRED:** Choose strategic direction before proceeding with any code changes.

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: THE DECORATOR LOADING GAP

### What Works Perfectly:

**Approach A: Direct Compilation (createTestHost)**
```typescript
const host = await createAsyncAPITestHost();
host.addTypeSpecFile("test.tsp", "@channel('/test') op test(): void;");
const result = await host.diagnose("test.tsp", {
  emit: ["@lars-artmann/typespec-asyncapi"]
});
// ✅ Decorators EXECUTE
// ✅ State POPULATED
// ✅ Files WRITTEN to real filesystem
// ✅ Tests PASS
```

**Evidence of Working:**
- test/integration/simple-emitter.test.ts: 3/3 passing
- Files written to `./@lars-artmann/typespec-asyncapi/`
- Decorator state correctly populated
- Generated AsyncAPI documents are valid

### What Fails Completely:

**Approach B: EmitterTester API (Broken)**
```typescript
const tester = await createTester(packageRoot, {
  libraries: ["@lars-artmann/typespec-asyncapi"]
})
  .importLibraries()
  .using("TypeSpec.AsyncAPI")
  .emit("@lars-artmann/typespec-asyncapi", options);

const result = await tester.compile("@channel('/test') op test(): void;");
// ❌ Decorators DO NOT execute
// ❌ State REMAINS EMPTY: {channels: {}, messages: {}}
// ❌ Generated documents are BLANK
// ❌ No virtual or real files created
// ❌ Tests FAIL: "No AsyncAPI output generated"
```

**Evidence of Failing:**
- test/unit/emitter-core.test.ts: 0/12 passing
- Console logs show `$onEmit` called but decorators never execute
- Virtual filesystem empty: `result.fs.fs` has 0 keys
- Real filesystem: single old `AsyncAPI` file (unchanged)
- Consolidated state: `{channels: {}, messages: {}, servers: {}, ...}`

### The Critical Gap:

**Working Path (createTestHost):**
- ✅ Creates TypeSpec program
- ✅ Loads JavaScript library files (dist/src/tsp-index.js)
- ✅ Registers decorator functions with TypeSpec
- ✅ Executes decorator functions when processing TypeSpec AST
- ✅ Populates program stateMap with decorator data
- ✅ Emitter extracts state and generates files

**Failing Path (EmitterTester):**
- ✅ Creates TypeSpec program
- ❓ **Unknown:** Does it load JavaScript library files?
- ❓ **Unknown:** Are decorator functions registered?
- ❌ Decorator functions NEVER EXECUTE
- ❌ program stateMap remains empty
- ❌ Emitter extracts empty state, generates empty document
- ❌ emitFile writes minimal/empty output or nothing

### Debugging Evidence:

```
🔧 TEST HELP: result.fs: exists
🔧 TEST HELP: result.fs.fs: exists
🔧 TEST HELP: result.fs.fs keys: []  ← EMPTY!

🔍 EMITTER DEBUG: $onEmit called
🔍 EMITTER DEBUG: Raw state: {
  "channels": {},      ← EMPTY!
  "messages": {},      ← EMPTY!
  "servers": {},       ← EMPTY!
  ...
}
🔍 EMITTER DEBUG: Generated document with 0 channels
```

**Confirmed:** Emitter is called, but receives NO decorator data

---

## 🤔 ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESES (Ranked by Probability)

### Hypothesis A: EmitterTester Doesn't Load JavaScript Libraries (Probability: 60%)

**Theory:** EmitterTester compiles TypeSpec to AST but never imports/executes the JavaScript library files that contain decorator implementations.

**Evidence:**
- No console.log output from decorator functions in EmitterTester mode
- Decorators work with createTestHost (which uses `loadTypeSpecScript()` and explicit imports)
- virtual filesystem empty suggests nothing was written by emitter
- Real filesystem has stale file (unchanged from previous compilation)

**Test:** Check if `dist/src/tsp-index.js` loads during EmitterTester.compile()
```typescript
// Add console.log in dist/src/tsp-index.js
console.log("🔥 LIBRARY LOADED: tsp-index.js executed");
```

**If true:** Need to manually import library after EmitterTester creation

### Hypothesis B: Namespace Resolution Different in EmitterTester (Probability: 25%)

**Theory:** `.using("TypeSpec.AsyncAPI")` works in test setup but decorators are registered under different namespace or not registered at all in compiled program context.

**Evidence:**
- `.using()` is called and doesn't error
- No diagnostics about "unknown decorator"
- Importerror not thrown
- Just silent failure (decorators don't execute)

**Test:** Check what's in result.program.stateKeys or try direct namespace access
```typescript
console.log(Object.keys(result.program.stateMap));
```

**If true:** Need to register decorators manually or adjust namespace configuration

### Hypothesis C: EmitterTester Creates Isolated Context (Probability: 10%)

**Theory:** EmitterTester creates TypeSpec program in isolated context - library loads in test file context but decorators not registered with compiled program context.

**Evidence:**
- Decorators might be loaded but attached to wrong program instance
- Instance.create() might create fresh program without library bindings

**Test:** Check library registration after createInstance()
```typescript
const instance = await tester.createInstance();
console.log(instance.program.stateMap.size);
```

**If true:** Need to manually bridge library between test and program contexts

### Hypothesis D: TypeSpec 1.8.0 Changed Behavior (Probability: 5%)

**Theory:** TypeSpec 1.8.0 introduced changes to EmitterTester API that aren't documented, and existing examples use older patterns.

**Evidence:**
- commit d2e7c75 says "fixed" virtual FS by removing validation
- Previous developers struggled with EmitterTester
- No clear examples in TypeSpec docs of decorator-based emitter tests

**If true:** Need TypeSpec maintainer support or need to read TypeSpec source code

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC DECISION REQUIRED

### The Question:

**Which approach should we commit to for testing the TypeSpec AsyncAPI emitter?**

### The Options:

**Option A: Continue Debugging EmitterTester (HIGH RISK)**
- 🔴 Unclear timeline (1 day to 1 week+)
- 🔴 Unclear probability of success (10-30%)
- 🔴 Requires deep TypeSpec framework knowledge
- 🔴 May require TypeSpec maintainer support
- ✅ Uses "official" TypeSpec testing API if successful
- ⚠️ Even if fixed, API may be unstable across TypeSpec versions

**Option B: Switch to createTestHost (LOW RISK - STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)**
- ✅ Pattern already proven (3/3 tests passing)
- ✅ Immediate solution (2-4 hours to migrate 250 tests)
- ✅ Higher confidence of success (90%)
- ✅ More stable across TypeSpec versions
- ✅ Aligns with realistic user workflow (like CLI)
- ⚠️ Less "pure" than EmitterTester, but practical
- 🎯 Gets us to 80%+ test pass rate TODAY

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (BALANCED RISK)**
- 🟡 Use EmitterTester where decorators not needed (unit tests)
- 🟡 Use createTestHost where decorators needed (integration tests)
- 🟡 Document both patterns
- 🟡 Gradually standardize over time
- ⚠️ More complex, two code paths to maintain
- ✅ Gets us unblocked while preserving EmitterTester option

### My Professional Recommendation:

**Choose Option B: Switch to createTestHost/direct compilation approach**

**Rationale:**
1. **Proven to work:** simple-emitter.test.ts demonstrates full functionality
2. **Immediate results:** 250+ tests unblock in 2-4 hours
3. **Lower risk:** 90% confidence vs 10-30% for EmitterTester
4. **Practical:** Direct compilation matches user CLI workflow
5. **Maintainable:** Simpler to understand and debug
6. **Goal-oriented:** Achieves 80%+ test pass rate, proves system works

**Counter-argument for Option A (why NOT to continue EmitterTester):**
- Risk of spending days with no solution
- Even if solved, may be fragile across TypeSpec versions
- Better to have working system today than perfect system next week
- Can always revisit and improve testing approach later

**Counter-argument for Option C (why hybrid adds complexity):**
- Two different test patterns = more to maintain
- Harder for contributors to understand
- Doesn't solve core problem, just works around it
- Better to choose one approach and make it great

## 📋 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE (BY APPROACH)

### If Choosing Option A (Debug EmitterTester):

**Next Steps (4-8 hours):**
1. Add instrumentation to verify library loading in EmitterTester mode
2. Check if dist/src/tsp-index.js executes during EmitterTester compilation
3. Manually import library after createTester() to verify decorator loading
4. Try manual decorator registration after instance creation
5. Read TypeSpec source code to understand EmitterTester decorator loading
6. Create minimal reproduction case and ask TypeSpec maintainers

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Success (10-30%):** Decorators load and execute, tests pass
- **Partial (30-50%):** Partial understanding, more debugging needed
- **Failure (20-60%):** Cannot determine root cause, timeline extends to days

### If Choosing Option B (Switch to createTestHost):

**Next Steps (2-4 hours):**
1. Migrate test/unit/emitter-core.test.ts to use compileTypeSpecWithDecorators()
2. Update test/utils/emitter-test-helpers.ts to use test-helpers pattern
3. Run test suite and verify pass rate jumps to 80%+
4. Document the architectural decision (why not EmitterTester)
5. Update test writing guidelines for consistency

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Success (90%):** 250+ tests pass immediately
- **Test pass rate:** 80%+ (486/605 tests)
- **Confidence:** Very high, pattern already proven
- **Timeline:** 2-4 hours to full resolution

### If Choosing Option C (Hybrid):

**Next Steps (1-2 hours decision, 4-6 hours implementation):**
1. Document when to use EmitterTester vs createTestHost
2. Create utility functions for both approaches
3. Migrate critical tests to createTestHost
4. Keep simple unit tests on EmitterTester
5. Plan gradual migration path to single approach

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Partial success:** ~50-75% of tests unblocked
- **Complexity:** Higher, two code paths to maintain
- **Timeline:** 4-6 hours for partial resolution
- **Long-term:** Still need to standardize on one approach

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED (THE HARD WAY)

### What I Did Wrong:

**1. Didn't Research First**
- Jumped into debugging without understanding TypeSpec EmitterTester
- Spent 3 hours on wrong problem (virtual FS) before discovering decorator issue
- Lesson: Always check git history and documentation FIRST

**2. Didn't Compare Working vs Non-Working**
- Treated all failing tests as same problem
- Missed obvious pattern: createTestHost works, EmitterTester doesn't
- Lesson: Find what works, compare to what doesn't, identify the delta

**3. Theorized Before Instrumenting**
- Assumed virtual filesystem bridging was the issue
- Added complex code to bridge FS but real problem was decorators not executing
- Lesson: Add logging BEFORE theorizing, verify actual behavior

**4. Didn't Commit Incrementally**
- Modified test files without committing changes
- Lost track of what was tried
- Broke the golden rule of incremental commits
- Lesson: Each small change gets committed immediately

**5. No Systematic Root Cause Analysis**
- Chased theories instead of data
- Didn't systematically eliminate possibilities
- Lesson: Be methodical, collect evidence, form hypothesis from data

### What I Should Have Done:

**Better Approach:**
1. ✅ Run test suite, identify patterns (passing vs failing)
2. ✅ Compare simple-emitter.test.ts (PASSING) vs emitter-core.test.ts (FAILING)
3. ✅ Notice createTestHost vs EmitterTester difference
4. ✅ Instrument to verify decorators execute or not
5. ✅ Confirm decorators never execute in EmitterTester mode
6. ✅ Make decision: debug EmitterTester or switch approach
7. ✅ Document decision rationale

**Time Savings:** Could have identified root cause in 1 hour instead of 3 hours

## 🎯 MY #1 UNANSWERABLE QUESTION

**"Why do TypeSpec decorators execute correctly with createTestHost() but NEVER execute when using EmitterTester.compile()?"**

### What I've Verified:

✅ **Library path:** correct (`@lars-artmann/typespec-asyncapi`)  
✅ **Library exports:** `dist/src/tsp-index.js` exports `$decorators`  
✅ **Package.json:** `tspMain: "lib/main.tsp"` points to correct lib  
✅ **Import call:** `.importLibraries()` called in test setup  
✅ **Emit call:** `.emit("@lars-artmann/typespec-asyncapi")` called  
✅ **Using declaration:** `.using("TypeSpec.AsyncAPI")` added  
✅ **Emitter invoked:** `$onEmit` called successfully  
❌ **Decorators execute:** NEVER happen in EmitterTester mode

### What I Cannot Determine:

❓ Is the JavaScript library file (`dist/src/tsp-index.js`) loaded?  
❓ Are decorator functions registered with TypeSpec program?  
❓ If registered, why aren't they executed during AST processing?  
❓ Is this a TypeSpec 1.8.0 undocumented behavior change?  
❓ Do other emitters face this same issue?

### What I Need:

1. **Working example:** Show me ANY TypeSpec emitter test that uses EmitterTester with decorators  
2. **API documentation:** Official EmitterTester documentation showing decorator loading pattern  
3. **Source code inspection:** Read TypeSpec compiler source to understand loading mechanism  
4. **Community help:** Ask TypeSpec maintainers about EmitterTester decorator loading  
5. **Verification method:** Way to inspect what's registered in TypeSpec program's decorator registry

**Without one of these, I cannot solve this problem through external observation alone.**

This is a **deep TypeSpec framework integration issue**, not a simple configuration bug.

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**YOUR DECISION NEEDED:**

Which strategic approach should I commit to?

**A)** [ ] Continue debugging EmitterTester decorator loading (high risk, uncertain timeline)
  - Add more instrumentation
  - Try manual decorator registration
  - Research TypeSpec source code
  - Contact TypeSpec maintainers for help

**B)** [ ] Switch to createTestHost/direct compilation approach (low risk, immediate unblock)
  - Migrate emitter-core tests to use compileTypeSpecWithDecorators()
  - Update test helper utilities
  - Maintain createTestHost as primary testing strategy
  - Achieve 80%+ test pass rate today

**C)** [ ] Hybrid approach (balanced risk, partial unblock)
  - Use EmitterTester for simple unit tests
  - Use createTestHost for integration tests requiring decorators
  - Document both patterns
  - Plan gradual migration path

**D)** [ ] Pause and research more before deciding
  - Gather working examples from other TypeSpec emitters
  - Read TypeSpec source code
  - Create minimal reproduction case
  - Request guidance from TypeSpec community

**Recommendation:** B - Switch to createTestHost for immediate unblocking

**Estimated time for B:** 2-4 hours to achieve 80%+ test pass rate

**What should I do next? (Choose A, B, C, or D)**
