**Before/After Impact:**
```yaml
# Before: Missing bindings
channels:
  channel_publishUserEvent:
    address: user.events

# After: Complete bindings
channels:
  channel_publishUserEvent:
    address: user.events
    bindings:
      kafka:
        topic: user.events
        bindingVersion: "0.5.0"
```

### @header Decorator Implementation
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/main.tsp` - TypeSpec decorator definition
- `src/decorators/message.ts` - Complete implementation logic
- `src/lib.ts` - State key registration
