# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-09-02T21:30:00+02:00

I was asked to perform:
Update and enhance the README.md to world-class standards, then provide brutal honesty assessment about the project state, identify ghost systems, and manage GitHub issues with comprehensive planning.

I was given these context information's:
- Project structure and codebase analysis access
- GitHub CLI permissions for issue management  
- Instructions to use @larsartmann/typespec-asyncapi namespace
- Request for brutal honesty about project state
- Command to analyze GitHub issues and create comprehensive planning

I was missing these information:
- Clear decision on package namespace (@larsartmann vs @typespec) - this was resolved during session
- Specific business priorities for feature vs infrastructure work
- Definition of "production ready" vs current alpha state expectations
- Timeline constraints for fixing blocking issues
- Resource allocation for ghost system removal vs new feature development

I was confused by:
- Initial optimistic project status claims vs actual broken build system
- Extensive documentation claiming "production ready" when basic compilation fails
- Complex cloud provider and marketplace systems that don't compile or provide user value
- Mismatch between comprehensive test infrastructure (56 files) and inability to run tests due to build failures

What I wish for the future is:
- Clear infrastructure vs features prioritization framework
- Evidence-based development approach (metrics before assumptions)
- "Make it work, then make it perfect" development philosophy
- Regular build health checks to prevent ghost system accumulation
- User-first development focus (can they install and use it successfully?)
