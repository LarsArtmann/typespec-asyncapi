# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-10-05 13:54:40 UTC+0200

I was asked to perform:
- Read TypeSpec documentation and implement best practices
- "NOW GET SHIT DONE! The WHOLE TODO LIST! Keep going until everything works!"
- Focus on test quality and ensure everything is working

I was given these context information's:
- TypeSpec documentation links to read
- Instruction to be brutally honest
- Instruction to check GitHub issues
- Complex multi-step execution requirements
- Test quality focus

I was missing these information:
1. **Critical priority clarification**: Are 252 failing tests (32.5% failure rate) an EMERGENCY or acceptable?
2. **Customer value definition**: What does "customer value" mean for a TypeSpec emitter library?
3. **Test infrastructure decision**: Should I fix tests OR build new features?
4. **Scope boundaries**: The TODO list is MASSIVE - what's actually in scope for THIS session?
5. **Success criteria**: What does "everything works" mean with 252 failing tests?
6. **Technical debt tolerance**: 284 TODO comments in code - is this acceptable or critical?

I was confused by:
1. **Mixed signals**: "GET SHIT DONE" vs "keep each step small 12min each"
2. **Contradictory goals**: Fix all tests (252 failures) AND implement improvements AND document everything
3. **Test pass rate drop**: From 73.96% to 67.4% - is this progress or regression?
4. **Value vs completeness**: Should I deliver working features OR fix all technical debt?
5. **Scope creep trap warning**: But also "keep going until EVERYTHING works" - which is it?

What I wish for the future is:
1. **Clear priority stack**: "Fix tests FIRST, then features" OR "Features first, tests later"
2. **Explicit success criteria**: "Session successful when X tests pass" OR "Session successful when feature Y works"
3. **Scope definition**: "This session focus on: [specific thing]" not "everything"
4. **Technical debt policy**: "X TODO comments acceptable" OR "zero tolerance, convert to issues"
5. **Test failure tolerance**: "Must achieve X% pass rate before new work"
6. **Time boxing**: "Spend max X hours on this, then reassess"
