# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

I was asked to perform:
Execute comprehensive 179-task micro-task plan to increase test pass rate from 70% to 90%+, fix all architectural issues, and achieve production-ready quality.

I was given these context information's:
- 179 micro-task breakdown (≤12 min each)
- 36 comprehensive tasks (30-100 min each)
- Test pass rate: 407/580 (70%)
- GitHub issues list
- Architecture context from CLAUDE.md
- Previous session summary showing Effect.TS migration work

I was missing these information:
1. **Alpha vs Beta emitter distinction** - Didn't know Alpha was deprecated/fallback
2. **File output location strategy** - Tests expect hardcoded paths, emitter uses different logic
3. **ValidationService binding issue root cause** - `this.validateDocument` undefined in nested Effect.gen
4. **Which tests are high-value vs low-value** - Wasted time on cosmetic fixes instead of critical bugs
5. **Whether to delete or fix Alpha emitter** - Unclear if it's needed as fallback
6. **AssetEmitter file writing behavior** - Don't understand where files actually get written
7. **Test infrastructure problems** - compileAsyncAPISpecWithoutErrors() doesn't log file paths for debugging

I was confused by:
1. **Micro-task plan rigidity** - Should I follow it strictly or jump to high-impact work?
2. **Test pass rate not improving** - First 2 tasks "completed" but 407/580 unchanged
3. **Time estimates way off** - 12-min tasks taking 20-30 min, why?
4. **Split brain between Alpha/Beta** - Which code path should I focus on?
5. **File path expectations** - Tests check `/test/@lars-artmann/typespec-asyncapi/asyncapi.yaml` but is that correct?
6. **Scope creep in plan** - 179 tasks include documentation/cleanup, should I skip those?
7. **Effect.TS binding patterns** - When can I use `this` in Effect.gen vs when do I need standalone functions?

What I wish for the future is:
1. **Clear priority system** - "Fix these 10 critical bugs FIRST, everything else is optional"
2. **Better test infrastructure** - Helper that logs all output file paths automatically for debugging
3. **Architecture decision records** - Why was Alpha emitter kept? Why dual file writing?
4. **Effect.TS pattern guide** - Clear rules for when to use `this` vs standalone functions
5. **Test categorization** - Tag tests as "critical/high-value/nice-to-have/deprecated"
6. **Realistic time estimates** - Either make tasks truly ≤12 min or estimate 20-30 min
7. **Focus metric** - Track "test pass rate improvement per hour" instead of "tasks completed"
