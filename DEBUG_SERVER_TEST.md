# Server Processing Debug Report

## Current Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation working
- ✅ Library registration working  
- ✅ Decorator syntax fixed (`#{...}` instead of `{...}`)
- ✅ Operations processing working (schemas being converted)
- ❌ Server decorators not being processed
- ❌ Servers not appearing in final AsyncAPI document

## Evidence from Test Logs

### Working Components
```
🚀 Loading built-in protocol plugins...
✅ Plugin kafka registered successfully
✅ Built-in plugins loaded successfully
✅ Property id converted to: {"type":"string"}
```

### Missing Components
- No server decorator processing logs (`🌐 PROCESSING @server decorator`)
- No server building logs (`🔍 Building servers: found X namespace(s)`)
- No pipeline stage logs (`🚀 Starting emission pipeline stages`)

## Root Issue Analysis

The problem is likely that the `@server` decorator is not being invoked at all during TypeSpec compilation. This could be because:

1. The decorator is not registered properly in the TypeSpec library
2. The decorator syntax is still incorrect
3. The TypeScript compilation resulted in malformed decorator JavaScript

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Test Server Decorator Registration
Create a minimal test to verify the server decorator is being called:
```tsp
@server("test", #{ url: "test://localhost", protocol: "test" })
namespace TestNamespace;

model TestEvent { id: string; }

@channel("test")
@subscribe 
op testOp(): TestEvent;
```

### 2. Check Compiled JavaScript
Verify that the compiled `dist/decorators/server.js` contains the `$server` function properly.

### 3. Add Direct Server Building Test
Test `buildServersFromNamespaces()` directly with a known good program state.

### 4. Fix Integration Path
Once server decorators work, ensure the EmissionPipeline Stage 3 is being executed to populate servers in the final document.

## Expected Fix Sequence
1. Fix server decorator invocation
2. Fix server state storage  
3. Fix server building from state
4. Fix server integration in final document
5. Test protocol bindings integration
