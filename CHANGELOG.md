### üîÑ Migration from Alpha

No breaking changes from 0.0.1-alpha.1. Direct upgrade recommended.

## [0.0.1-alpha.1] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- Initial TypeSpec AsyncAPI 3.0 emitter implementation
- AssetEmitter architecture for proper TypeSpec integration
- Core AsyncAPI decorators: `@channel`, `@publish`, `@subscribe`, `@server`

## [0.9.0-beta.1] - 2025-10-07

### üéâ Beta Release - Production Ready

This beta release marks a significant milestone with enhanced test infrastructure, comprehensive examples, and critical bug fixes. The emitter is production-ready and fully operational for AsyncAPI 3.0 generation from TypeSpec definitions.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Smoke Test Example**: Added `examples/smoke/` directory with minimal working example
- **Test Infrastructure**: New CLI-based testing architecture with comprehensive documentation
- **Architecture Documentation**: `CLI-TEST-ARCHITECTURE.md` with mermaid diagrams and migration strategy

- **Strategic Planning**: Pareto analysis documentation for shipping strategy

### üîß Fixed
- **ESLint Critical Errors**: Resolved unsafe argument and explicit any errors in AsyncAPIEmitter.ts
- **CLI Usage**: Corrected TypeSpec CLI invocation from `npx tsp` to `tsp compile` with proper paths
- **Type Cache Bugs**: Fixed property access errors (`this.cache` ‚Üí `this.storage`)
- **Smoke Test Documentation**: Updated README with correct compilation commands

### üìö Documentation
- Enhanced smoke test README with dual command approaches (project root vs subdirectory)
- Added detailed test architecture documentation (550+ lines)
- Strategic shipping plan with 100 micro-tasks breakdown
- Comprehensive test conversion templates and patterns

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure
